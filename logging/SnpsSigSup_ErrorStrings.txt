#PURPOSE if your log matches these, you have a problem, of some sort.  Use like grep --file /home/pjalajas/dev/git/SynopsysScripts/logging/SnpsSigSup_ErrorStrings.txt
#
#USAGE: '\[pjalajas@sup-pjalajas-hub N00862113]\$ (time (parallel "grep -E --file /home/pjalajas/dev/git/SynopsysScripts/logging/SnpsSigSup_ErrorStrings.txt \{\} | bash /home/pjalajas/dev/git/SynopsysScripts/logging/SnpsSigSup_RedactSed.bash" ::: ./blackduck_bds_logs-20210622T073818/standard/*/app-log/2021-06-22.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -k1nr | head -n 10000000) ) | gzip -9 > ErrorStrings_RedactSed_$(hostname -f)_$(date --utc +%Y%m%d%H%M%SZ%a).out.txt.gz 2>&1'
#
#NOTES:
#no blank lines in this file, they match everything
#try to eventually make all case-sensitive, for precision and speed
#whitespace is important, including trailing, used for anchoring grep
#not sure whether to err on side of including false positives or missing false negatives; kind of leaning toward worst case, include false positives
#but aggressivelly remove those lines matching under only normal conditions.
#Some errors are known spurious; should probably remove those, but not sure.
#Ok to leave customer hostnames etc in, they should be unique enough for this purpose, but need to redact them for external distribution.
